# Path Smoothing Evaulation (Python)

## 1. Intro
This project was created as a research project for my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science/Games and Simulation Arts and Sciences at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. It is a Python/Pygame implementation of various path smoothing algorithms. The paper compares the performance of these algorithms, both in terms of execution time and how close the resulting path is to a pre-computed optimal path length.
